The UHG Consumer & Customer Engagement (CCE) Data Platform is a comprehensive, enterprise‑grade data ecosystem designed to unify ingestion, processing, governance, analytics, and activation of consumer and customer engagement data across UnitedHealth Group. The platform enables scalable, secure, and governed data operations that support advanced analytics, AI/ML workloads, and downstream business functions including Marketing, Digital, Sales, and Service. 
This platform is a modern, end‑to‑end Azure-based data and AI system designed for UHG/Optum to: 
Ingest source data from many systems and build a single source of truth. 
Clean, validate, secure, and store the data using a Medallion Architecture (Bronze → Silver → Gold), ensuring the data quality. 
Run analytics, AI/ML workflows, and SQL queries. 
Publish curated datasets to business domains (Marketing, Sales, Digital, Service). 
Share data via Power BI, Unity Catalog Shares, and self-service interfaces. 
 
1. Source Layer 
The platform integrates data from diverse enterprise systems such as SQL databases, SharePoint, PeopleSoft, Oracle, and manually curated inputs. This heterogeneous data is securely ingested from operational sources into the CCE environment using standardized ingestion patterns. 
 
2. Ingestion Layer 
The ingestion layer operationalizes data onboarding through: 
Azure Event Hubs for real‑time and event‑driven ingestion 
Azure Data Factory (Batch + CDC) for scheduled, incremental, and bulk data movement across systems 
Automated pipelines that standardize raw data capture and ensure reliable delivery downstream 
This foundation ensures that structured and semi‑structured data enters the platform in a controlled and auditable manner. 
 
3. Processing & AI Layer 
This is the core analytical engine of the CCE platform, supporting both data engineering and data science workloads. 
Key components include: 
Data Quality & Validation frameworks to enforce accuracy, completeness, and consistency 
Azure Databricks (CCE Computing) for scalable processing, ML workflows, and SQL analytics 
Unity Catalog for centralized governance, lineage, privileges, and metadata management 
Workflows/Jobs to operationalize ELT pipelines and advanced analytical workloads 
Together, these components enable high‑performance data transformation, model development, and operational AI. 
 
4. Storage & Medallion Architecture 
The platform follows a Medallion (Bronze–Silver–Gold) architecture within the CCE Delta Lake, enabling progressive refinement of data: 
Bronze – Raw, ingested data 
Silver – Cleaned, validated, and enriched datasets 
Gold – Curated business-ready data products optimized for analytics and consumption 
This layered approach ensures quality, consistency, and reusability across functional teams. 
 
5. Product/Data Mart Layer 
The curated Gold datasets feed dedicated data marts that serve key business domains: 
Marketing 
Digital 
Sales 
Service 
These marts provide domain‑aligned, analytics‑ready datasets used for reporting, segmentation, personalization, performance tracking, and operational decision-making. 
 
6. AI Concierge / Serving Layer 
The AI Concierge layer orchestrates data activation and enterprise consumption through: 
Power BI dashboards 
Catalog Sharing for internal and external partners 
Self‑Service capabilities enabling business users to discover, explore, and consume governed datasets 
Workspace Sharing to collaborate with analytics teams and data scientists 
This ensures broad accessibility while maintaining strict governance and compliance controls. 
 
7. Governance & Security Layer 
A comprehensive governance and security foundation spans all platform components, including: 
Activity Logs & Diagnostic Logs for auditing 
Azure Active Directory for identity and access management 
Microsoft Defender & Security Center for threat protection 
Cost Management Dashboards for workload optimization 
ML/AI Alerts for monitoring data quality, drift, and model health 
This layer ensures compliance with enterprise and regulatory requirements while safeguarding sensitive consumer data. 
 
Summary 
Overall, the UHG CCE Data Platform delivers a robust, governed, and scalable foundation for powering consumer and customer engagement analytics. By combining modern ingestion, lakehouse architecture, centralized governance, and AI‑driven insights, the platform enables faster decision‑making, data democratization, and improved customer experiences across the organization. 
 
 AI System: (State of art statistics ML, DL & LLM)
"""
Block 1: Proactive Data Concierge AI 
Purpose: Single “front door” for finding, understanding, and safely using governed data products (and escalating issues automatically). 
Experience layer: Chat UI + “Ask data” entrypoint (Purview + Databricks AI/BI Genie).  
Policy aware: never answers or suggests datasets the user can’t access (Unity Catalog + Purview access policies).  
Proactive: subscribes to monitoring + lineage signals to notify owners before business users feel impact.  
Actions are gated: proposes remediations; execution goes through workflow approvals/CI. (Put “Proposal → Approve → Execute” on the slide.) 
  
Block 2: Data Product Concierge (Discovery + Definitions + Access) 
What it does: “Give me the right Gold dataset, with the right definition, and the right access path.” 
Search by intent: uses Purview Unified Catalog data products + glossary (business terms, owners, certified assets).  
Explains meaning: “grain, key dimensions, metric definitions, certified use cases.” 
Self-service access: uses data product access policies (request access, approvals, terms of use).  
Outputs: recommended data product(s) + sample query patterns + “how to get access”. 
  
  
Block 3: Quality Triage Agent (Anomaly → Root Cause → Fix Plan) 
What it does: Turns a “data anomaly” into a diagnosis + recovery playbook. 
Trigger: freshness/completeness anomalies and monitoring events across tables/schemas.  
Reads: monitoring logging tables + recent pipeline runs + lineage dependencies.  
Explains: what changed, when, which upstream job/source likely caused it, which downstream products are impacted.  
Proposes fixes: backfill window, replay from Bronze, re-run Silver→Gold, or rollback to last known good Delta version (as applicable). 
  
  
Block 4: Schema Drift Agent (Contract Guardian) 
What it does: Detects drift early and recommends the minimum safe change. 
Trigger: schema/type changes, missing fields, unexpected null spikes; also failed “expectations” checks.  
Quality gates (write-time): recommends/updates pipeline expectations (fail update / drop bad records / quarantine) so drift doesn’t silently contaminate Gold. 
Blast radius: uses lineage to identify exactly which Silver/Gold tables will break if drift is accepted.  
Outputs: “compatibility report” + proposed mapping/patch + contract version note for the data product. 
  
  
Block 5: Impact Analysis Agent (Change → Who Breaks?) 
What it does: “If we change table X/column Y, what breaks?” 
Source of truth: Unity Catalog lineage (table/column lineage + system tables + REST API).  
Outputs: ranked list of impacted assets:  
downstream Gold products/views, 
dashboards/consumers, 
ML feature tables/pipelines, 
owners + refresh SLA. 
Use cases: safe deprecation, migration planning, incident triage, compliance audits. 
  
  
Block 6: Auto-Documentation Agent (Docs that Don’t Rot) 
What it does: Keeps documentation continuously correct, tied to reality. 
Reads: schemas + expectations metrics + monitoring signals + lineage graph.  
Generates: purpose, grain, “how to use”, key joins, sensitive fields notes, SLAs, owners. 
Publishes back: updates catalog metadata and links data assets into data products/glossary context (Purview) and keeps lineage references current (UC). 
  
  
Block 7: Enterprise Lineage Bridge (Databricks ↔ Purview) 
What it does: Makes lineage visible across tools, not only inside Databricks. 
Mechanism: OpenLineage-based connector transfers Spark/Databricks lineage into Microsoft Purview.  
Value: end-to-end tracing for business + auditors: sources → pipelines → curated products → consumption. 
  
  
Final Block: “Ask Data” Interface (Business Self-Serve) 
If you want a dedicated UX block on the slide: 
Databricks AI/BI Genie: natural language Q&A over governed data; can be managed and integrated via APIs.  
Purview Discovery: find data products + request access with policy workflow.
