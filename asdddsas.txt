The story starts at the Source Layer, a diverse neighborhood filled with many different systems: 
SQL Server databases 
SharePoint sites 
PostgreSQL 
Oracle databases 
API-driven applications 
Operational tools and file-based systems 
Each of these systems produces valuable information about our consumers, customers, and interactions. These systems are independent, fragmented, and speak different data languages, and our mission is to bring them all into one unified ecosystem. 
Brings raw data into Azure. 
1.1 Azure Event Hubs 
Handles real‑time / streaming data (events, logs, API feeds). 
Think: continuous data pipeline. 
1.2 Azure Data Factory (Batch / CDC) 
Brings batch data (files, DB extracts). 
CDC (Change Data Capture) tracks only changed data. 
Think: scheduled pulls + incremental updates. 

 Description of the UHG Consumer & Customer Engagement (CCE) Data Platform 
 The UHG Consumer & Customer Engagement (CCE) Data Platform is a comprehensive, enterprise‑grade data ecosystem designed to unify ingestion, processing, governance, analytics, and activation of consumer and customer engagement data across UnitedHealth Group. The platform enables scalable, secure, and governed data operations that support advanced analytics, AI/ML workloads, and downstream business functions including Marketing, Digital, Sales, and Service. 
 
 
1. Source Layer 
The platform integrates data from diverse enterprise systems such as SQL databases, SharePoint, PeopleSoft, Oracle, and manually curated inputs. This heterogeneous data is securely ingested from operational sources into the CCE environment using standardized ingestion patterns. 
 
2. Ingestion Layer 
The ingestion layer operationalizes data onboarding through: 
Azure Event Hubs for real‑time and event‑driven ingestion 
Azure Data Factory (Batch + CDC) for scheduled, incremental, and bulk data movement across systems 
Automated pipelines that standardize raw data capture and ensure reliable delivery downstream 
This foundation ensures that structured and semi‑structured data enters the platform in a controlled and auditable manner. 
 
3. Processing & AI Layer 
This is the core analytical engine of the CCE platform, supporting both data engineering and data science workloads. 
Key components include: 
Data Quality & Validation frameworks to enforce accuracy, completeness, and consistency 
Azure Databricks (CCE Computing) for scalable processing, ML workflows, and SQL analytics 
Unity Catalog for centralized governance, lineage, privileges, and metadata management 
Workflows/Jobs to operationalize ELT pipelines and advanced analytical workloads 
Together, these components enable high‑performance data transformation, model development, and operational AI. 
 
4. Storage & Medallion Architecture 
The platform follows a Medallion (Bronze–Silver–Gold) architecture within the CCE Delta Lake, enabling progressive refinement of data: 
Bronze – Raw, ingested data 
Silver – Cleaned, validated, and enriched datasets 
Gold – Curated business-ready data products optimized for analytics and consumption 
This layered approach ensures quality, consistency, and reusability across functional teams. 
 
5. Product/Data Mart Layer 
The curated Gold datasets feed dedicated data marts that serve key business domains: 
Marketing 
Digital 
Sales 
Service 
These marts provide domain‑aligned, analytics‑ready datasets used for reporting, segmentation, personalization, performance tracking, and operational decision-making. 
 
6. AI Concierge / Serving Layer 
The AI Concierge layer orchestrates data activation and enterprise consumption through: 
Power BI dashboards 
Catalog Sharing for internal and external partners 
Self‑Service capabilities enabling business users to discover, explore, and consume governed datasets 
Workspace Sharing to collaborate with analytics teams and data scientists 
This ensures broad accessibility while maintaining strict governance and compliance controls. 
 
7. Governance & Security Layer 
A comprehensive governance and security foundation spans all platform components, including: 
Activity Logs & Diagnostic Logs for auditing 
Azure Active Directory for identity and access management 
Microsoft Defender & Security Center for threat protection 
Cost Management Dashboards for workload optimization 
ML/AI Alerts for monitoring data quality, drift, and model health 
This layer ensures compliance with enterprise and regulatory requirements while safeguarding sensitive consumer data. 
 
Summary 
Overall, the UHG CCE Data Platform delivers a robust, governed, and scalable foundation for powering consumer and customer engagement analytics. By combining modern ingestion, lakehouse architecture, centralized governance, and AI‑driven insights, the platform enables faster decision‑making, data democratization, and improved customer experiences across the organization.
