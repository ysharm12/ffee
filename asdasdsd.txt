Creating an Intelligent Data Backbone for Personalized, Connected Health Engagement
Why Now?
The next era of growth for UHG will be defined by how well we understand and engage
consumers as individuals—not just as members, patients, or customers, but as whole humans
across care, coverage, and experience journeys.
However, today’s data environment is fragmented:
• Consumer insights are siloed across Marketing, Digital, Sales, and Service.
• Data access is slow, governed inconsistently, and optimized for reporting—not engagement.
• Teams depend on tech functions for even simple audience queries or personalization logic.
To unlock precision engagement and operational intelligence, UHG needs a centralized
Consumer & Client Engagement Data Product— a cross-functional capability that fuses data
strategy, product thinking, and platform execution to power all consumer & client-facing
functions.
